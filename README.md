silverstripe-admin-google-map
=============================

This is a very basic module for getting a Google Map into the Silverstripe CMS.

It provides a map with a draggable pin that, upon being moved, updates latitude and longitude CMS fields.

##Installation

Simply download a copy of this repo, or add it as a submodule via git, to the root of your SilverStripe installation.

Add the following line to your site's _config.php (with your Google Map key):

```
define("GOOGLE_MAP_KEY", "your_key");
```

Don't forget to run ``dev/build?flush=all``

##Basic Usage

By default, the module will expect the following situation

1. There will be fields with the IDs **Form_ItemEditForm_Lat** and **Form_ItemEditForm_Lng** (fields with the names Lat and Lng will have these IDs given to them by SilverStripe).

2. These fields will be in a CMS tab with the ID of **Root_Location**

You would then simply need to create a GoogleMapField, giving it a name as you would with a SilverStripe field, for example:

```
public function getCMSFields() {

	$fields = parent::getCMSFields();

	$fields->addFieldsToTab("Root.Location", array(
		// Create hidden latitude field
		HiddenField::create("Lat"),
		// Create hidden longitude field
		HiddenField::create("Lng"),
		// Create Google map field
		GoogleMapField::create("Map", array(
		
			// Override any default options
			
		))
	));
	
	return $fields;

}
```

##Address geolocation

You can optionally add a text field that allows the user to search for a location. A button is provided for the user to click and update the map.

##Options

If your situation isn't the same as above, you can provide any of the following options to suit your setup.

These options can be passed as key => value pairs as the second argument of the **GoogleMapField** function. These options and their default values are:

```
$googleMapField = GoogleMapField::create("Map", array(
  "height" => "500px",                          // The height of the map element
  "heading" => "",                              // A heading in a <h4> tag to appear before the map
  "lng_field" => "Form_ItemEditForm_Lng",       // The ID of the longitude input element
  "lat_field" => "Form_ItemEditForm_Lat",       // The ID of the latitude input element
  "tab" => "Root_Location",                     // The ID of the tab that the map is in
  "address_field" => "Address",                 // The ID of the address field (if it exists)
  "map_zoom" => 10,                             // The initial zoom level of the map
  "start_lat" => "51.508515",                   // The initial latitude of the map marker
  "start_lng" => "-0.125487"                    // The initial longitude of the map marker
));
```
